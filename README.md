# Ultramarathon Data Analysis: Exploring Trends and Insights

## 1. Background
Ultramarathons, races exceeding the traditional marathon distance of 26.2 miles, have gained immense popularity in recent years. These endurance events attract athletes of all ages and backgrounds, pushing their physical and mental limits. Understanding the trends and factors influencing performance in ultramarathons can provide valuable insights for both runners and race organizers.

## 2. Introduction
This project delves into the world of ultramarathons, analyzing a vast dataset of over 7 million race records spanning two centuries. Using Python, Pandas and Seaborn, we explore the data to uncover interesting trends and insights about ultramarathon runners and their performances.

## 3. Aims
The primary aim of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the ultramarathon dataset. This includes:

** Data Cleaning ** : Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, addressing inconsistencies and missing values.


** Descriptive Analysis ** : Exploring key variables like race distance, runner age, gender, and finishing time to understand the overall distribution and characteristics of the data.


** Visualizations ** : Creating insightful visualizations to highlight trends and patterns in the data, such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.


** Comparative Analysis ** : Comparing different race distances, genders, and age groups to identify significant differences and potential factors influencing performance.

## 4. Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of ultramarathon race records from Kaggle. It contains information about:

Race Details: Race name, date, distance, location, and number of finishers.

Runner Information: Runner's name, age, gender, and finishing time.

## 5. Analyst Questions
This project aims to answer several business questions related to ultramarathons, including

 1. How do runner speeds differ between 50K and 50-mile races, and how does gender influence these differences?
  
  
 2. What age groups are most successful in 50-mile races, and what are the minimum race participation requirements for these groups?
    
  
 3. Is there a noticeable difference in runner speed between summer and winter races?

  
 4. What are the key factors influencing runner performance in ultramarathons?


By answering these questions, we gain valuable insights into the ultramarathon running community and the factors that contribute to success in these challenging events.
